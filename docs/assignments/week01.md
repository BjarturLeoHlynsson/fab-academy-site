### More info

I first started by following these [Instructions](https://www.fabisa.is/N%C3%A1msefni/Pre-Fab/1-heimasidugerd/) provided to me by [Svavar Konradsson](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/isafjordur/students/svavar-konradsson/index.html), Which where very helpful in getting [MK Docs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) set up. MK Docs is a simplified version  of HTML that uses Markdown. There are plenty of different themes available but i decided to use the [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme.
