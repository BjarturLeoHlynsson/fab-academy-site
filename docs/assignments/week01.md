### Set up a documentation website using GitLab.

I first started by following these [Instructions](https://www.fabisa.is/N%C3%A1msefni/Pre-Fab/1-heimasidugerd/) provided to me by [Svavar Konradsson](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/isafjordur/students/svavar-konradsson/index.html), Which where very helpful in getting [MK Docs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) set up.
