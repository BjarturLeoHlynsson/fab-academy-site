# Pre Fab

Before I start, please note that some of the websites I linked to are in Icelandic, so have a translator ready if you want to use the same instructions! All websites in Icelandic will have the icelandic flag in the link.

This year, Fab Lab Ísland decided to start Fab Academy a bit early to better prepare students, and [:flag_is: Fab Lab Ísafjörður](https://www.fabisa.is) decided to host it. My instructor for Pre-Fab is [Svavar Konráðsson](https://fabacademy.org/2023/labs/isafjordur/students/svavar-konradsson/index.html) and my Lab instructor is  Frosti Gíslason, his Fab Academy site could not be found so here is the [Lab Website for Fab Academy 2024](https://fabacademy.org/2024/labs/vestmannaeyjar/about/)

More information on this initiative be found on the [:flag_is: Fab Isa Site](https://www.fabisa.is/N%C3%A1msefni/Pre-Fab/0-yfirlit/).
